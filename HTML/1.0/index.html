            Richard Matthew Stallman, often known by his initials, <strong>rms</strong>, is an American free software movement activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html" target="_blank">GNU Project</a>, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License.
